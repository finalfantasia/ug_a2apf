This is a converter JavaScript module written for Safari (or UIWebView) in iOS, which converts Uyghur letters in the basic Arabic region to their presentation forms in the regions of Arabic Presentation Forms A and B. This module was written to make it possible to render Uyghur letters in specified WOFF fonts in Safari (or UIWebView) as it currently doesn't fully support WOFF for Arabic letters in the basic range. Parts of the code are based on the conversion algorithm ([utext.c](http://tarim.yulghun.com/src/utext/utext.html)) originally written by Mr. Muhemmed Abdullah.
